Abstract

Our plan is to create a LeetCode/HackerRank style website where people can practice their programming skills on many different problems.  The main issue that we noticed with the LeetCode style of website is that it often feels like a grind when prepping for interviews or when practicing programming and logic skills.  We wanted a way to make it as fun as possible and we realized a good way to do that was to "gameify" it by adding an element of competition. A user would be able to go head to head with another user to try and solve the coding challenge as quick as possible within a set time limit.  At our websites most basic level we would like to have two users, one problem, a compiler, and a single language to code in.  Once we have the basics we can add more functionality, such as some sort of ranking system, a matchmaking system and expand upon the number of problems, languages, and users we are able to support.
